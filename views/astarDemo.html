        <p>
            A common problem in computer science is the need to find the shortest distance between two points over a
            series of nodes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A*</a> is but one of several
            different path finding algorithms designed to find the shortest, fastest path from one given node to another.
        </p>
        <p>
            Select a node on the grid and it will be highlighted, then selected a second node. If there is a possible
            path between the two nodes, the algorithm will find the shortest path from start to finish and highlight
            it in green. Simply click again to reset it.
